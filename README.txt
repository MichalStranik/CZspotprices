The application allows you to receive daily updates on the current spot electricity prices for the CZ market. Additionally, it enables you to add distribution costs to these prices for each hour and define the hours during which you utilize the lower tariff.

Based on the current price or price index, you can further control your flows.

For proper functionality, add the device to Homey, set the distribution costs, and specify the hours during which the lower tariff is available. The distribution costs will then be included in the prices during the next update.
